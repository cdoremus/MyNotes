Haiku: Dragonfly Rescue

A flutter on the lake
A dragonfly rescue attempt
Life renewed again

Haiku for Diana

Diana a giving soul
Her heart overflows with concern
She has butterfly's effect


In Diana's love sphere
Many are corralled and cared for
Smiles are contagious

Smart is not enough
Artistic she is but much more
Her talents are many

She is a true believer
But she also lives her beliefs
God beams from above


Haiku: It's called fishing, not catching

Pphhhht, phhht, phhht, phhht plop
An angler's fly lands perfectly
The trout is not fooled

Haiku: Turkey crossing

Stop! Turkeys ahead
Twenty one in actuality
No stuffing for them

Haiku: Hopp-along Little Birdie

Sandpiper one leg lame
Hop hop hop one leg hop hop
It's exhausting to watch

Haiku: Late summer sun

Sunlight on water
Like floating fireflies in dance
Flash before my eyes
