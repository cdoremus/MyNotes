# Cost estimate for printing newsletter via online vendor

The online quote for 12 page - full color saddle stitched (so more like a magazine) premium 32/80# text smooth, for 150 copies is $341.86 without the 15% off coupon.  Price would be less with different quality paper.   This would not be folded in half but mailed magazine style - which would be kind of cool for our 50th Anniversary Edition.
We would also have to factor in approximately $40 for envelopes.  Mailing would cost more - first class flat is $1.22.per unit.  So $183 for mailing 150 units.
Total for 150 mailed would be approximately $565.

# Newsletters

## Summer Fall Newsletter 
### Articles & Pics
Article on Summer Party 
- Maybe part of President's report 

Article on local weather stations.


Pic by Bill Fichtell
- Him and granddaughter 

Pics from Chris 
- IPP group 
- Water quality sampling
## Corrections to Winter spring newsletter 
### Chris Ricardi's article 
- The last line in the first full paragraph in the second column contains "that we can be made". Just remove the "we" from that sentence.
- The last line in the article contains the phrase "in a VP". Change that to "in as VP".
### 2024-2025 Board of Directors box
- Catherine Caswell is the current Vice President.
### John Salisbury's article on land Assessment 
- The title should have a space after the '&'.
- The third line in the article should read "...less than six-tenths of a percent..."
- The third paragraph should start with "The assessment records..."
- The last line in the article should read "Two of the most recent properties with homes on the lake sold for an amount more than 200%..."
- The credit at the end of the article has a typo. Change it to "Compiled by: John Salisbury"
### Sabbathday Lake Milestones 
- Please remove this section. I'm sure there are plenty of SDLA milestones between 1975 and 2001 that we're missing here. Chris and I tried to make an appointment with Br Arnold for over a month so we could see SDLA archival material, but he never got back to us. I even appealed to the Board for help and Paula got us permission to use that excerpt from the book, but that's all we have right now. We will continue to work on this to put together a more complete timeline for the 50th party (where we'll have a memories bulletin board) and publish it in the fall newsletter.
  I really appreciate your effort on this, Diantha, but I don't want Tom Johnson and other old timers to see this and be hurt that their history was given short shrift. I hope you'll understand my perspective.
- If you need content for this space, we can publish the full Certificate of Organization of a Corporation document on this page. I think people would be interested in knowing that originally the SDLA founders wanted to build swimming pools and tennis courts on the lake and "operate exclusively for recreational and social purposes".
- On second thought it might be good to just pull out some choice quotes from the certificate like the one I just quoted and other parts that talk about swimming pools and tennis courts and reference them to the document. 

### 50 years of Ice Out Dates chart
- Credit Rick Fortier for compiling the data below the chart.
### Charter Members graphic
- Credit to: "From original Certificate of Organization of a Corporation submitted to the State of Maine"
## Mike's article on IPP history 
- The second line should add space between "are" and "critical"
- The third line of the second paragraph should end with "...37 bodies of water"
- The line in the second paragraph should that starts with "Hitchhiking..." should end with a period: "... and vehicles." instead of a comma. The next line in that paragraph has "deterioration" misspelled. 
- In the highlights section, the second bullet point should read "We did the first partial lake survey in 2011 (Level 2)" adding the "in" before 2011.
- The fourth bullet point should merge in with the third one as a separate sentence. "... Grange Hall. Thirteen of our SDLA IPP..."
- Get rid of the asterisks (\*) at the end of the second to last bullet point. (My bad!)
- Remove the quote (") at the end of the last paragraph (...the lake for future generations.).
### Lori Wills Fowler article 
- Add a title and byline as I suggested previously 
- Change in the last paragraph "The other picture in 1968..." to "The other picture taken in 1968..."
### Formation of the Sabbathday Lake Association article 
- Note that the photos are of the Sabbathday Lake Grange. You should also add that SDLA meetings were held there for many years including the first one in 1975. The credit can be in small type.
### Multigenerational Reflections
- The Sun Journal photo has the caption cut off so you can't read it and know who's in the picture.
### Photos on back cover 
- The Driscolls photo: Who is/are TommElaine?  In the last line, what is "y David..."? There seems to be one or more left off of this list of names since it ends with an "and".
- Water skiers group: Change "...photo is likely Young's and Driscolls" to "...photo is likely of Youngs and Driscolls"
