## 50th Anniversary Newsletter Issue Announcement 

This spring's issue of the Sabbathday Lake Association newsletter will focus on our 50th anniversary. With that in mind, we would like to see historical articles and photos from our members and anyone else having a history with the lake.

The articles should focus on the writer's personal history.  Some ideas along these lines include:
- Your fond lake remembrances and/or funny stories.
- A recollection of family members who inspired you to love the lake. 
- A favorite or inspiring encounter with lake wildlife.
- Memories of helping to monitor the lake for invasive plants or water quality.

We're not looking for your memoirs, just an article of 3-6 paragraphs. If you're not the writerly type, just send us some notes (as bullet points) that we will turn into an article.

Also solicited are photos of past times at the lake. These photos do not have to illustrate your article, just something that shows a fun time or fond lake remembrance. Make sure you identify people in the photos (in order). We can accept electronic copies, preferably of jpg format, or original photos that we can digitize and send back to you.

Please send all items to newsletter editor Craig Doremus at cdoremus@gmail.com or 28 Black Point Road, New Gloucester 04260. Submission deadline is April 30th. If possible, please include your phone number just in case we need to contact you for further clarification. And if you have any questions, please contact Craig via email. Thank you.

## Melissa True 50th article 

### Multigenerational SDL recollections

The families of Melissa (Thurston) and George True are multigenerational residents of Sabbathday Lake. Melissa remembers her grandmother fishing on the lake. "She really loved to fish," Melissa recalled from her lakeside residence built by her dad in 1946.

People use to help each other out, she noted. Melissa remembers her dad helping a group erect a screen so the culvert under Outlet Road would not clog with debris. Her dad William Thurston - a founding member of the SDLA who recently passed away - lived next door to Melissa and George on Outlet Road.

Her grandmother Gladys and grandfather Chas Errold Thurston families summered in adjacent lake cottages "The met here and fell in love", said Melissa. Her parents were also paired together at Sabbathday Lake as were Melissa and George.

Melissa said her parents seem to know a lot of people around the lake. She described "float parties" that they used to have where they went from float to float at residences around the lake, stopping for refreshments along the way. "People just knew each other", she said.

There were poker games, her dad told Melissa, where people would wager their lake "shacks" as collateral. Just think what that bet would be worth today!

# Corrections to Winter spring newsletter 
### Chris Ricardi's article 
- The last line in the first full paragraph in the second column contains "that we can be made". Just remove the "we" from that sentence.
- The last line in the article contains the phrase "in a VP". Change that to "in as VP".
### 2024-2025 Board of Directors box
- Catherine Caswell is the current Vice President.
### John Salisbury's article on land Assessment 
- The title should have a space after the '&'.
- The third line in the article should read "...less than six-tenths of a percent..."
- The third paragraph should start with "The assessment records..."
- The last line in the article should read "Two of the most recent properties with homes on the lake sold for an amount more than 200%..."
- The credit at the end of the article has a typo. Change it to "Compiled by: John Salisbury"
### Sabbathday Lake Milestones 
- Please remove this section. I'm sure there are plenty of SDLA milestones between 1975 and 2001 that we're missing here. Chris and I tried to make an appointment with Br Arnold for over a month so we could see SDLA archival material, but he never got back to us. I even appealed to the Board for help and Paula got us permission to use that excerpt from the book, but that's all we have right now. We will continue to work on this to put together a more complete timeline for the 50th party (where we'll have a memories bulletin board) and publish it in the fall newsletter.
  I really appreciate your effort on this, Diantha, but I don't want Tom Johnson and other old timers to see this and be hurt that their history was given short shrift. I hope you'll understand my perspective.
- If you need content for this space, we can publish the full Certificate of Organization of a Corporation document on this page. I think people would be interested in knowing that originally the SDLA founders wanted to build swimming pools and tennis courts on the lake and "operate exclusively for recreational and social purposes".
- On second thought it might be good to just pull out some choice quotes from the certificate like the one I just quoted and other parts that talk about swimming pools and tennis courts and reference them to the document. 

### 50 years of Ice Out Dates chart
- Credit Rick Fortier for compiling the data below the chart.
### Charter Members graphic
- Credit to: "From original Certificate of Organization of a Corporation submitted to the State of Maine"
## Mike's article on IPP history 
- The second line should add space between "are" and "critical"
- The third line of the second paragraph should end with "...37 bodies of water"
- The line in the second paragraph should that starts with "Hitchhiking..." should end with a period: "... and vehicles." instead of a comma. The next line in that paragraph has "deterioration" misspelled. 
- In the highlights section, the second bullet point should read "We did the first partial lake survey in 2011 (Level 2)" adding the "in" before 2011.
- The fourth bullet point should merge in with the third one as a separate sentence. "... Grange Hall. Thirteen of our SDLA IPP..."
- Get rid of the asterisks (\*) at the end of the second to last bullet point. (My bad!)
- Remove the quote (") at the end of the last paragraph (...the lake for future generations.).
### Lori Wills Fowler article 
- Add a title and byline as I suggested previously 
- Change in the last paragraph "The other picture in 1968..." to "The other picture taken in 1968..."
### Formation of the Sabbathday Lake Association article 
- Note that the photos are of the Sabbathday Lake Grange. You should also add that SDLA meetings were held there for many years including the first one in 1975. The credit can be in small type.
### Multigenerational Reflections
- The Sun Journal photo has the caption cut off so you can't read it and know who's in the picture.
### Photos on back cover 
- The Driscolls photo: Who is/are TommElaine?  In the last line, what is "y David..."? There seems to be one or more left off of this list of names since it ends with an "and".
- Water skiers group: Change "...photo is likely Young's and Driscolls" to "...photo is likely of Youngs and Driscolls"
