We saw this on our trip and thought it was a perfect birthday gift for you. So we guess you're going to have to find your own vodka, wine, cheese and chocolate. 

Instead we are sending you bour early birthday wishes and the knowledge that you are loved.
Love, c&d

and hope that you can find a cool spot in the shade to fan yourself and enjoy your new puppy.
